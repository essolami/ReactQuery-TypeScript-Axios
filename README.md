# ReactQuery-TypeScript-Axios

This is a full-stack web application that combines a React frontend with a Node.js backend. The frontend is built with Create React App, TypeScript, React Query, and Axios, while the backend is powered by Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL, Redis, and TypeORM, and is containerized using Docker.

## Getting Started

To get the project up and running, follow these steps:

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the `FrontEnd` directory.

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install

3. Run Project:

   ```bash
   npm start

### Backend Setup

1. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install

2. Once all of the above is set up correctly, we need to run the docker containers.

   docker-compose up -d

3. Run Project:

   ```bash
   npm start
